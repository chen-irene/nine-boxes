# nine-boxes

Nine Boxes is a tablet game created with the purpose of helping Taiwanese seniors improve their memory. Specifically, this game was built upon the classic
Simon Says type game, where a pattern is given to the user and must be repeated. In this case, the game and UI/UX design were tweaked based on accessibility 
for the senior target market.

This minigame is part of a larger app with other minigames, programmed by other student contributers.
